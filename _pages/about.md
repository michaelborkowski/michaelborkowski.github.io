I am a Ph.D. candidate in the Department of Computer Science and Engineering at UC San Diego, affiliated with the [ProgSys Group](https://cseweb.ucsd.edu/groups/progsys/). My academic interests include software verification, functional programming, refinment types, and mechanizing metatheory. I am fortunate to be advised by [Ranjit Jhala](https://ranjitjhala.github.io). Previously, I completed a B.A. in Computer Science at Amherst College.

**I am on the job market this year** for positions starting in Fall 2024.
My [teaching statement](/files/teaching.pdf), 
[research statement](/files/research.pdf), and 
[diversity statement](/files/diversity.pdf) are available here.
