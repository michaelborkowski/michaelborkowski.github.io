I am an Assistant Professor of Practice in the Department of Computer Science at Purdue University. Before joining Purdue,
I earned my Ph.D. from the Department of Computer Science and Engineering at UC San Diego, where I was affiliated with the [ProgSys Group](https://cseweb.ucsd.edu/groups/progsys/). 
At UCSD I was very fortunate to be advised by [Ranjit Jhala](https://ranjitjhala.github.io).
My research interests include software verification, functional programming, refinment types, and mechanizing large proofs.
